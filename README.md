* brain-calc - The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example, 35 + 16, which needs to be calculated and the correct answer recorded.
* brain-gcd - The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown two random numbers, for example, 25 50. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common factor of these numbers.
* brain-prime - We show the player a series of numbers that forms an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number.
* brain-progression - Show the player a number and he must determine whether it is simple or not.
